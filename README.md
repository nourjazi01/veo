Educ.

1. Project Overview

Description:
A Flask-based platform designed to make learning more practical and inclusive, addressing the challenges of theoretical learning and accessibility for students with disabilities.

Inspiration:
We chose this idea to bridge the gap between theoretical education and practical application. Our goal is to foster an inclusive environment where every student, regardless of ability, can learn interactively and effectively.
SDG 4: Quality Education 
Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.
SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities
By supporting disabled individuals and offering inclusive education, your website helps bridge learning gaps and promote equal opportunities.
